## Game objective
To safely move up the screen all the way to the water, at the top. To do so, you must avoid any contact with the bugs along the way.

Whether you're just starting the game or your character just died, you will start/restart gameplay at the bottom-middle square.


## Navigating the screen
Use your keyboard's arrow keys to move up, down, left or right on the screen.
